    <p style="background-color: azure;">Dog behavior problems are often misunderstood or mishandled by dog owners. 
        Perhaps you are new to dog ownership, considering getting a dog, or just wish to help your dog with a challenging issue. 
        Thoroughly understanding the most common dog behavior problems is the first step to solving and preventing them. 
        A solid foundation of obedience training will help you prevent or better control many of these issues.</p>
